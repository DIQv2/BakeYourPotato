        <h2>Origins!</h2>
        <p>
          Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) originated in the Andes Mountains of
          South America, specifically in what is now Peru and Bolivia.

        <h2>Varieties</h2>
        <p>
          Potatoes are a good source of vitamins and minerals, particularly
          vitamin C, potassium, vitamin B6, and fiber. They are also relatively
          low in calories when prepared without added fats or oils.

        <h2>Versatility</h2>
        <p>
          Potatoes are an incredibly versatile food and can be cooked in
          numerous ways, including boiling, baking, frying, mashing, and
          roasting. They are a staple ingredient in many cuisines around the
          world.

      <div class="factObject" onmouseover="dragFact(this)">
        <h2>Starch Content</h2>
        <p>
          Potatoes are composed mainly of carbohydrates, with starch being the
          predominant form. This makes them a good source of energy, especially
          for those engaging in physical activities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="factObject" onmouseover="dragFact(this)">
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>
          Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dark, and well-ventilated place
          to prevent sprouting and spoilage. Exposure to light can cause
          potatoes to turn green and develop a bitter taste due to the formation
          of solanine.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="factObject" onmouseover="dragFact(this)">
        <h2>Cultural Importance</h2>
        <p>
          Potatoes have played a significant role in human history, particularly
          during times of famine. They are credited with helping to alleviate
          hunger in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries and are a staple
          food in many parts of the world today.

      <div class="factObject" onmouseover="dragFact(this)">
        <h2>Genetic Diversity</h2>
        <p>
          The genetic diversity of potatoes is vast, with wild varieties still
          existing in the Andes region. This diversity has been crucial in
          breeding programs aimed at developing disease-resistant and
          higher-yielding potato varieties.

        <h2>Top Potato Producers</h2>
        <p>
          China is the world's largest producer of potatoes, followed by India
          and Russia. Other major potato-producing countries include Ukraine,
          the United States, and Germany.
